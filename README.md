  ### 1.1. How Does the Internet Actually Work?
  -	**Internet** is a long piece of wire, And that wire connects different computers to each other. It allows computers to transfer data through this giant wire
  -	A server is a computer that provides files and data to other computers, it allows access 24/7.
  -	A client is a computer that any user is used to access the internet.
  -	When the browser request a website, the request is sent to **ISP** (Internet server provider: The company we pay for internet service) then it searches at DNS that contains the web site's IP addresses. Once the DNS finds the IP address it sends it back to the browser vis ISP. Then the browser sends a direct request through ISP and this message will be delivered via Internet Backbone to the server that is located at that IP address. On that server, all files are needed to view the website home page. The server sends these files back to the client through the internet backbone and the client gets to see the website in the browser. All of that happens in milliseconds.
